# coupon-system-client

This application is the final project I created during my software studies.<br/>
The application is a Fullstack project, it is written in Java language on the server side and in React on the client side.

### 🤔 What is the purpose of this application?

This is a coupon management system that allows companies to generate coupons as part of advertising and marketing campaigns that they run.<br/>
The system also has registered customers, the customers can purchase coupons, coupons are limited in quantity and validity, a customer is limited to one coupon of each type.<br/>
The system records the coupons purchased by each customer.<br/>
The revenue of the system is from the purchase of coupons by the customers and by the creation of new coupons by the companies.

### 💻 Access to the system is divided into three types of clients:

1. Administrator - manages the system, managing the lists of companies and the customers.<br/>
2. Company – managing a list of coupons associated with the company.<br/>
3. Customer - who buy coupons.<br/>

# The project structure:

This project is the client side of the “Coupon System" application.<br/>
This part of the application was written using React libraries and is built as a Single Page Application (SPA).<br/>
Communication with the server side is done by using RESTful API.

## Layout

In terms of the project structure, there is a main layout for the website's main page, that also contains a link to the login page. In addition, after logging in, the client will be transferred to a special layout according to the client type(I created a different page for the 3 types of users).

## Components

I build components adapted for all the actions and operations that exist in the system.<br/>
The components are arranged according to the types of clients. Each client has actions that he is authorized to perform (for example an admin can delete a company, and he is the only one authorized to do so).

## Models

I added Models that correspond to the Java Beans classes that are on the server side.

## Routing

Routing mechanism that is suitable for the various Routes that exist on the server side.

## Redux

I used Redux which manage and update the state of an application.

## Design

The design done by using CSS, Material UI and Bootstrap.

# And what about the Server side?

For the Server side I used Java language and Spring Framework.<br/>
To store data in the database I used Spring Hibernate JPA(SQL).<br/>
For the authentication & authorization I used the JWT technique.<br/>
